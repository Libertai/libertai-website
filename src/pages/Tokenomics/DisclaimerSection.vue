					The LibertAI Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although
					LibertAI Platform has certain features and specifications that are set forth in the litepaper and website, the
					team may make changes to such features and specifications for any number of reasons, any of which may mean
					that the LibertAI Token Platform does not meet the holders expectations. Furthermore, it is specified that
					future situations or a change in circumstances may lead the team to bring, at its sole discretion, amendments,
					changes or updates to the Tokensâ€™ tokenomics, including without limitation the maximum supply, vesting
					schedules or token distribution ratios, allocation or timings.
					<br /><br />
					The tokens do not provide the holders with rights of any form with respect to the company/team or its revenues
					or assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary
					(including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights; (ii) are not a loan to the
					company and do not entitle the holder to repayment of principal amount or interest; and (iii) do not provide
					the holder with any ownership or other interest in company such as rights to any return, or any
					profit-participation right or rights to payments of any kind whatsoever.
